font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Department of Geology was established in 1962-63 with the admission of students to the first year B.Sc. Degree Course in Geology. This was the only college in the entire Malabar area in those days that offered an under-graduate course in Geology. The growth and development of the Department had played a pivotal role in shaping the future of hundreds of geologists of Kasaragod and adjoining districts. The Post-graduate course in M.Sc. Geology was started in 1979 and the Department has already started the Golden Jubilee Celebrations on January 6<sup>th</sup> 2013, which was inaugurated by Sri. N.A. Nellikunnu, honourable M.L.A of Kasaragod. This is the only college which offers B.Sc. and M.Sc. courses in Geology under Kannur University. It was elevated to a Research Centre in 2005 and since then the Department has been redesignated as Department of Post-Graduate Studies and Research in Geology.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

Prof.Sriram,  Prof.V.Gopinathan and Dr. P.V.Vijayan were at the helm of affairs of Govt.College as&#160; Principal in succession during 2007 , 2008 and 2009 respectively</span>.</span></span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"> Several students of this department have served in various organizations/institutions/departments in India and abroad. Many are working as Class 1 officers in the Geological Survey of India (GSI), Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), Centre for Earth Science Studies (CESS), Central Ground Water Board (CGWB), National Institute of Oceanography (NIO), National Centre for Antarctic and Ocean Research (NCAOR), Goa, Centre for Water Resources Development and Management (CWRDM), Kozhikode, Kerala State Council for Science, Technology and Environment (KCSTE), National Institute of Hydrology (NIH), Remote Sensing Utilization Centers, Land Management Departments, Logging Engineers and Geophysicists, Kerala State Ground Water Department, State Department of Mining and Geology and in various Universities and Colleges as faculty members.

font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">The department has been rendering great service to the people of this region for the last five decades. The field investigations undertaken by the M.Sc. students in connection with their dissertation/ project work helped to collect factual data on the hydrogeological conditions of the region and the environmental degradation as a result of unscientific developmental activities. The need for sustainable development is given due importance in under-graduate as well as and post-graduate curriculum. The department has been actively involved in extension work in connection with the Peoples Planning Programme during the X plan at Panchayath levels. Various awareness programmes are also undertaken from time to time. Short Term Courses, Exhibitions, Refresher Courses for High School and College teachers, National Seminars, etc. were conducted to make the people aware about the need to protect the environment, to stop soil erosion and prevent landslides. As part of its extension activities, the Department is always positive in extending its service by conducting Exhibitions open to university students, Higher Secondary School teachers and School students and donating collection of minerals, rocks and fossils to institutions not only to develop their laboratory but also to make teaching in schools more efficient and student friendly. Queries from the general public and teachers of universities and schools are answered properly regarding rocks and minerals of peculiar type encountered in their area and useful advices and recommendations regarding soil, land and water etc are done free of cost by the Department.</span></p>

The department has undertaken Research Projects funded by STED and DST. Presently there is one UGC Minor Research Project entitled 'Solid Waste Management in Kasaragod Municipality and Surrounding Panchayaths' with a fund allocation of 1.90 lakhs. Former Department faculty Dr. M.A. Mohammed Aslam has been nominated as Syndicate Member of Kannur University since Dec 2012. Some of the teachers have presented papers in National and International Seminars.</span></p>

A great number of alumni visit the department regularly and help as Resource Persons whenever Seminars/ Lectures/ Workshops are arranged in the department. The Department has been imparting quality education to the new generation to pave way for budding geologists of future generation by a team of dedicated teachers by ensuring a student friendly and calm academic atmosphere in the Department. The results of UGC-CSIR JRF/NET Examination, UPSC Geologists Examinations, and University Examinations within and outside the state during the last several decades have made indelible impression in the society that the students who passed out from this institution are behind none; for a good percentage of them have secured enviable ranks and good placement. In this context, the faculty of the Department is determined to rededicate ourselves by re-affirming our sincerity and faith in imparting quality education for the society in general and the Department in particular.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
